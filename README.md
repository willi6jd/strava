With an authenticated Strava Athlete, this application allows a user to view their Strava activities on the Desktop via the Strava API. Using the Google Maps API, the geostring provided by Strava is decoded and used to display the location of the most recent activity by the athlete. Additionally, this app allows the user to add a new activity to their Strava account.
